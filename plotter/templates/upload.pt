  <div metal:fill-slot="content">

    <p>Please upload your profile data to segment as a
      gzipped <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html">bedGraph</a>
      file:</p>

    <pre>
track type=bedGraph db=hg19 name=nb1 export=yes description="Neuroblastoma 1 aCGH logratio" share=public maxSegments=20 visibility=full alwaysZero=on graphType=points yLineMark=0 yLineOnOff=on 
chr1 809681 809690 0.447843644362086
chr1 928433 928460 0.462575888042204
chr1 987423 987454 0.500802053057158
...</pre>

    <p>The columns are: chromosome, chromStart, chromEnd, signal. For
      accurate analysis and interpretation, please verify
      that <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQtracks.html#tracks1">chromStart
	is 0-based and chromEnd is 1-based in bedGraph files</a>. That is, the
      first base in the interval is labeled on UCSC as chromStart+1, and the
      interval contains all bases up to AND INCLUDING the chromEnd base.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Example 1: your signal comes from
	the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=genotypeArrays">Agilent
	  SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray 1x1M AMADID 021529</a>. One of the
	probes is
	named <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?position=A_16_P21235033">A_16_P21235033</a>. This
	probe's sequence is TGACCC...TAAAAC, which is labeled on the browser
	as <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?position=chr21:33036221-33036280">chr21:33036221-33036280</a>,
	but the bedGraph format for this location
	is <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?position=chr21
		    33036220 33036280">chr21 33036220 33036280</a>! Note the bedGraph
	chromStart is 1 base less than the display chromStart!</li>
      <li>Example 2: your signal is log counts of sequences found in 1kb
	windows evenly spaced throughout the genome. The first window on
	chromosome 1 is displayed on the browser
	as <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?position=chr1:1-1000">chr1:1-1000</a>
	= bedGraph
	format <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?position=chr1
			0 1000">chr1 0 1000</a>. The second window is
	<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?position=chr1:1001-2000">chr1:1001-2000</a>
	= bedGraph
	format <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?position=chr1
			1000 2000">chr1 1000 2000</a>, etc.</li>

      <p>The website displays scatterplots of signal versus chromStart. For
	each chromosome, we segment the signal, ordered using chromStart. </p>

      <p>Please create these required header fields:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><tt>type=bedGraph</tt> must be specified, according to the UCSC
	  file format definition.</li>
	<li><tt>db=hg19</tt> specifies the genome version of the
	  coordinates. This will appear in the bed and bedGraph data
	  exports.</li>
	<li><tt>name=someUniqueID123</tt> specifies up to 30
	  alphanumeric characters that will be used as a unique ID for
	  the profile. Check the <a href="/all_profiles/">profile
	  table</a> to make sure there are no other profiles with the
	  same <tt>name</tt>.
	</li>
	<li><tt>export</tt> specifies if the data can be exported for
	visualization on the UCSC genome browser:
	  <ul>
	    <li><tt>yes</tt> UCSC can download the probes,
	    annotations, breakpoints, and segmentation via a public
	    URL.</li>
	    <li><tt>no</tt> the data will not be available for
	      download via a public URL. If you want to visualize your
	      data on a genome browser, then you will have to download
	      the data exports yourself, and upload them manually to a
	      genome browser.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li><tt>description="up to 59 characters that describe this
	    profile"</tt> will be used in the bed and bedGraph data
	    exports. If you upload this profile to the UCSC genome
	    browser, the description appears as the title of the
	    track.
	</li>
	<li><tt>share</tt> specifies who can see the profile:
	  <ul>
	    <li><tt>public</tt> all website users.</li>
	    <li><tt>private</tt> only to the user that uploads it.</li>
	    <li>A domain name such as <tt>curie.fr</tt>
	    or <tt>stat.berkeley.edu</tt>, which means that only users
	    with emails ending with the specified domain will be
	    allowed.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <tt>maxSegments</tt> should be an integer that specifies the
	  maximum number of segments for pre-calculated models. Larger
	  values slow down the profile preprocessing, but increase the
	  number of breakpoints available in saved models.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you have many files to upload, you may want to
	use <a href="/static/upload_profiles.py">upload_profiles.py</a>.</p>
