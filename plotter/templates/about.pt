    <h2>Introduction: selecting a smoothing model using breakpoint
    annotations</h2>

    <p>The basic idea is to find a model which agrees with your visual
      definition of a breakpoint. Our approach to segmentation uses computer
      vision and machine learning, exploiting the strong points of your eyes
      and mathematical models:</p>

    <table class="compare">
      <tr>
	<th>Breakpoint detector</th>
	<th>Strong points</th>
	<th>Weak points</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>Your eyes</td>
	<td>Identifying outliers, noise, and breakpoints over large regions</td>
	<td>Finding the exact breakpoint</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>Mathematical models</td>
	<td>Use optimization to find the breakpoints of maximum likelihood</td>
	<td>Tuning parameters that limit the number of breakpoints, <br />and
	  must be chosen using various heuristics</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Each scatterplot of probe logratio is shown with a piecewise
      constant smoothing model. If the breakpoints detected by the
      model are not what you expect, then you can add breakpoint
      annotations to update the segmentation. Breakpoint annotations
      are regions that encode your visual interpretation of the
      signal, and were first described for segmentation model
      selection
      in <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/164">Learning
      smoothing models of copy number profiles using breakpoint
      annotations</a>.</p>

    <h2>Model details</h2>

    <p>When a profile is uploaded, each chromosome is pre-processed:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/imagedraw.htm">Python
	Imaging Library</a> is used to draw PNG scatterplots for
	several zoom levels, so even high-density profiles can be
	quickly plotted and zoomed.</li>
	<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0887">Pruned Dynamic
	Programming (DP)</a> is used to find the optimal segmentation for
	several model sizes.</li>
      </ul>
    <p><b>Optimal fitting:</b> the displayed segmentation can be
edited by adding 0/1 breakpoint annotations on the bottom half of the
plot. Given a set of breakpoint annotations, <b>how do we find a
consistent segmentation?</b> The color of the displayed breakpoints
indicates the algorithm used to find the displayed segmentation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>green=PrunedDP</b>. After annotation, we first check if
there are any segmentations with 0 annotation error from Pruned DP. If
there are, we use one of those.
</li>
<li><b>purple=SegAnnot</b>. If there are no 0-error segmentations
from Pruned DP,
then <a href="http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00759129">SegAnnot</a> is used
to find the most likely segmentation that is consistent with the given
annotations. Thus the segmentation model is always consistent with the
visually-defined breakpoint annotations.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Optimal prediction:</b> if there are few breakpoint annotations,
then there may be several Pruned DP segmentations which are
consistent. For example, when there are no breakpoint annotations, all
the Pruned DP models are consistent. In that case, <b>how do we
predict the optimal number of breakpoints?</b> We use
a <a href="http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/hocking13.html">max-margin
interval regression model learned on all the other annotated
signals</a> to select the number of breakpoints. The breakpoint
detection of this model gets better as you add more breakpoint
annotations.</p>

<p><b>Copy number annotations:</b> there are 5 copy number annotations:</p>
<table class="compare">
  <tr>
    <td>Annotation</td>
    <td>Approximate copy number</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>amplification</td>
    <td>&gt;&gt;2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>gain</td>
    <td>&gt;2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>normal</td>
    <td>â‰ˆ2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>loss</td>
    <td>&lt;2, typically 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>deletion</td>
    <td>&lt;&lt;2, typically 0</td>
  </tr>
</table>
  <p>Each copy number annotation is used to assign a copy number
  status to its overlapping segment. Annotated segments are the same
  color as the copy number annotations, and un-annotated segments are
  green. The annotated segments of a profile are used to predict copy
  number status for un-annotated segments on the same profile. But
  copy number is not generalized between profiles, so you need to
  label a few segments on each profile.</p>

    <h2>Web browser compatibility</h2>
    <p>Rendering large zoomed PNG scatterplots of high-density
    profiles is not supported on all browsers. For example,
    <a href="/profile/dr3hg19/2/">chr2 on profile dr3hg19</a> has
    153,662 probes, and the following table shows which web browsers
    can display the different zoom levels.</p>
