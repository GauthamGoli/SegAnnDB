This document describes the recommended development cycle for SegAnnDB
code.

Check out a read-write copy of the code from SVN to your local
computer.

svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svnroot/breakpoints/webapp/pyramid SegAnnDB

To support the database and uploaded files, you need to create the
following directories:

SegAnnDB/db: BerkeleyDB files.
SegAnnDB/chromlength: chromInfo.txt.gz files renamed to e.g. hg19.txt.gz.
SegAnnDB/secret: uploaded profiles and scatterplots.

Then set FILE_PREFIX="." in plotter/db.py. Then run

bash recover-restart.sh

to start a development server which uses the development.ini
file. Make changes to the source code and then change
FILE_PREFIX="/var/www" and then commit changes.

On the production server, we configured apache2 using the sample
apache.config file, which points to the production.ini file. To update
the code on the production server we run

bash server-update.sh

Which checks out the most recent version of the code from SVN, then
installs it, and restarts the web server. There are some other
server-*.sh scripts that can be run as well. 

WARNING: server-reinitialize.sh and reinitialize.sh will delete all
data in BerkeleyDB.
